# cancer-prediction
This project focuses on predicting breast cancer using machine learning techniques. It utilizes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset, which contains features computed from breast mass images. Using Python and libraries like Pandas and scikit-learn, the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed by removing irrelevant columns such as 'id' and 'Unnamed: 32'. The target variable is the diagnosis (malignant or benign), and a Logistic Regression model is trained on the selected features. The data is split into training and testing sets, and the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The model demonstrates strong performance in accurately predicting cancer diagnoses, showcasing the potential of AI in assisting early detection in healthcare.
